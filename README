jShaker is a simple jQuery plugin which runs a shake, vibrate effect on a selected web page element and all its children emulating an shaker effect.

It was original developed by ajaxblender.com ( you can see their website right here http://www.ajaxblender.com/jshaker.html ) but it was lacking a method to stop the shaking animation so that's what Ive added :) .

HOW TO USE IT:

1) Add jQuery to your project :
<script src="jquery-1.4.2.min.js" type="text/javascript"></script> 

2) Add jShaker to your project 
<script src="jshaker.js" type="text/javascript"></script>

3) Start shaking like this ;) :

<script type="text/javascript">
$(document).ready(function(){
   $('.block').click(function(){
          $(this).jshaker();
	     });
	     });
</script>

3.1) to stop the animation : $(".block").jshaker.stop() 

4) Find a good use, remember then this thing could slow down your browser so be careful.
